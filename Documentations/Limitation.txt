< Program >

1. The Program/Webpage is not that advanced and it have limitation. 
Which it only have basic function system like Create, Edit, View and Delete items from the webpage which will be update
on the database automatically too. 

2. The patients are able to view other patients appointment/booking data and details. 
I not sure how to restrict the patient to view their own data and details only. 

3. The AccountID For Doctor and Admin Control Panel when they wish to 
create a appointment for the user it show the AccountID (First Name) Instead of the
AccountID. Which i not sure how to fix that too. 

4. The Webpage/Program is quite simple without much function and input. 

5. This webpage/Program i would say is a skeleton or mock-up page given
the amount of time i have and learn MVC from the beginning. I would improve more
in the future and add more for function for it. 

6. I try to implement the Navigation Bar for the Admin, Doctor and Patient so that
they can click on the Navigation bar to return back to their own control panel
but i fail to do that. Because of the role restriction the other user role also
able to view the other Navigation Bar Link/Button. 

Example: The Admin can see Patient/Doctor Control Panel Navigation Bar Button 
same for the other way.

This is why i never implement this future/function for the Navigation bar. 

7. This webpage only have like 2 database but it should have more and properly linked
